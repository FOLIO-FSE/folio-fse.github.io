This section of the documentation is devoted to the task of migrating data for a library from their current system onto FOLIO.
We are describing the tools involved, and what you need to get going using them as well as describing the processes for the different areas of FOLIO.

If you are a librarian seeking information on this topic, the [For libraries](/docs/for-libraries/) section should contain enough documentation for you, but this section might hold additional information of interest to you.
